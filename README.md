## About the Project

This DemonCrawl recreation tries to replicate the original DemonCrawl. Using the Godot Engine, we try to create a game that feels similar to DemonCrawl, while fixing bugs that are present in the original, adding mod support and eventually adding new features.

## Installation

When the game is released, there will be a download in the `releases` secion on this page. Until then, you will have to compile the game yourself by installing Godot.

1. Install Godot on the [official website](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.2-stable/). *Note:* We use the `4.2.2` version of Godot.
2. If you plan on contributing, you should also [install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).
3. Get the source code. You can do this by cloning the repository or by downloading the source code directly from GitHub.
   To clone the repo: On GitHub Desktop, go to File -> Clone Repository -> URL and paste in this page's URL, then click `clone`.
4. Open the project in Godot:
   - Launch Godot Engine.
   - Click on `Import` and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository (or where you placed the files if you downloaded the source code directly).
   - Select the `project.godot` file and open the project.

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the project from within the Godot editor by clicking on the `Run Project` button in the top-right corner of the screen or by pressing `F5`.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make an open-source project work. Any contributions you make can greatly speed up development or simply make the game better. To contribute:

1. Install the source code (See the [Installation](#installation) section above)
2. Either pick an issue to work on and create a new branch for the issue or immediately create a new branch
3. Make changes
3. Commit your Changes
4. Push to the Branch
5. Open a Pull Request and wait for someone to merge the pull request

## Style Guide

There is a [style guide](docs/style-guide.md) in the project's files. Before contributing, make sure to read that file first and write code in a way that is similar to the rest of the project.
