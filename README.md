## About the Project

This DemonCrawl recreation tries to replicate the original DemonCrawl. We use the Godot Game Engine to create a game that not only looks but also feels similar to the original. We try to write the game in such a way that mod support will be feasible.

## Installation

When the game is released, there will be a download in the `releases` secion on this page. Until then, you will have to compile the game yourself by installing Godot.

1. Install Godot on the [official website](https://godotengine.org/).
2. If you plan on contributing, you should also [install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).
3. Get the source code.
   - If you do **not** plan to contribute, you can do this by cloning this repository or by downloading the source code directly from GitHub.
   To clone the repo: On GitHub Desktop, go to `File -> Clone Repository -> URL` and paste in this page's URL. Find a suitable location to place the files, and then click `clone`.
   - If you do plan on contributing, you should fork the repository before cloning it. See the [Forking the Repository](#forking-the-repository) section for details.
4. Open the project in Godot:
   - Launch Godot Engine.
   - Click on `Import` and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository (or where you placed the files if you downloaded the source code directly).
   - Select the `project.godot` file and open the project.

### Forking the repository

If you plan on contributing to this project, you should fork this repository before cloning it. To do so, press the `Fork` button in the top-right corner of the page. This will create a new repository under your account. Then, in GitHub Desktop, go to `File -> Clone Repository` and find the newly created fork (if it doesn't exist, you may need to restart GitHub Desktop). Next, find a suitable location to place the source code. Then press `clone` and GitHub Desktop will clone all files in the repository to your pc.

Finally, open the project in Godot by following the above steps.

If you want to update your fork to the latest version of this repository, you can go to `Branch -> Update from upstream/main`. If there are any new commits on the main branch of this project, they will be copied over to your fork.

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the project from within the Godot editor by clicking on the `Run Project` button in the top-right corner of the screen or by pressing `F5`.

## Contributing

As this is an open-source project, any contributions are highly appreciated. If you don't know how to code, that's okay: you can still contribute by researching DemonCrawl mechanics. For example, we don't really know how _exactly_ DemonCrawl generates its quests and stages, especially how it determines each stage's size, monster count, stage power and stage mods.

In addition, you can always help by playtesting the game, and trying to find bugs so we can fix them. If you encounter a bug, don't hesitate to create an issue on GitHub, or report it directly to me and I'll create an issue for you.

If you _do_ know how to code, or are willing to learn it for this project, you can follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository (See the [Installation](#installation) section above)
2. Either pick an issue to work on and create a new branch for the issue or immediately create a new branch (on your local fork)
3. Make changes
4. Commit your changes (remember to do this often so you never lose progress and so that commit titles can still make sense)
5. Push to the branch
6. Open a pull request and wait for someone to merge the pull request

If you are ever unsure on how to implement something, feel free to contact me on Discord.

## Style Guide

There is a [style guide](docs/style-guide.md) in the project's files. Before contributing code, make sure to read that file first and write code in a way that is similar to the rest of the project.
